# - Find FastLoader includes and required compiler flags and library dependencies
# Dependencies: C++17 support and threading library

# This file must be on the client project's CMake module path.
# The preferred way is to copy this file to a folder in the project directory
# and add the folder path to the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH variable.
# (see https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/How-To-Find-Libraries)
#
# The FastLoader_CXX_FLAGS should be added to the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
