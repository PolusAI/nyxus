ROI's contour calculation
-------------------------
The problem of finding the set of contour pixels based on the ROI point set boils down to the concepts of pixel neighborhood and connectivity.
We say that a pixel set :math:`C` is connected (or a connected component) if for every pair of
pixels :math:`p_i`, :math:`p_j` in :math:`C` there exists a sequence of pixels :math:`p_i,..., p_j` such that (1) it is contained in :math:`C` and (2)
every pair of pixels adjacent in the sequence are neighbors of each other. Since we now have two different types
of neighbors, we obtain two different types of connectivity. Accordingly, let :math:`C` be a set of "black" (i.e. of non-zero intensity) pixels.
We say that :math:`C` is 4-connected if for every pair of pixels :math:`p_i`, :math:`p_j` in :math:`C` there exists a sequence of pixels :math:`p_i,..., p_j`
such that (1) it is contained
in :math:`C` and (2) every pair of pixels adjacent in the sequence are 4-neighbors of each other. Similarly,
We say that :math:`C` is 8-connected (or an 8-connected component) if for every pair of pixels :math:`p_i`, :math:`p_j` in :math:`C`
there exists a sequence of pixels :math:`p_i,..., p_j` such that (1) it is contained in :math:`C` and (2) every pair of pixels
adjacent in the sequence are 8-neighbors of each other. Obviously a 4-connected pattern is an 8-
connected pattern but not vice-versa. One method of finding and analyzing the connected components of image :math:`T` is to scan :math:`T` in some
manner until a border pixel of a component :math:`C` is found and subsequently to trace the boundary of
:math:`C` until the entire boundary is obtained. The boundary thus obtained can be stored as a doublylinked
circular list of pixels or as a polygon of the boundary of the pixels in question. Such procedures
are generally termed contour tracing.

There are two
useful definitions of border points which are related to the boundary. We say that a
"black" pixel of :math:`C` is a 4-border point if at least one of its 4-neighbors is "white". We say that a "black"
pixel of :math:`C` is an 8-border point if at least one of its 8-neighbors is "white".

More popular modifications of Algorithm Square-Tracing to handle 8-connected patterns
discard the left-turn-right-turn rule altogether. One such procedure is known as Moore-neighborhood
tracing [1]. The eight neighbors of a pixel shown in the following figure are also referred to in the literature as
the Moore neighborhood of a pixel:

    :width: 100
    :align: center
    :alt: Pixel neighbors in Moore's algorithm

    Example: Pixel neighbors in Moore's algorithm

In the Moore neighborhood tracing algorithm, when the current pixel :math:`p` is "black",
the Moore neighborhood of :math:`p` is examined in a clockwise manner starting with
the pixel from which p was entered and advancing pixel by pixel until a new "black" pixel in :math:`C` is
encountered as illustrated in the following figure:

.. figure:: contour_tracing_moore_algorithm_2.jpg
    :width: 100
    :align: center
    :alt: Searching for the next "black" contour pixel in Moore-neighborhood contour tracing

    Example: Searching for the next "black" contour pixel in Moore-neighborhood contour tracing

The following figure shows an example of how the square tracing algorithm starting at the pixel marked
:math:`S` produces a sequence of boundary pixels in the case :math:`C` is 8-connected:

    :width: 300
    :align: center
    :alt: Square tracing an 8-connected pattern

    Example: Square tracing an 8-connected pattern

The algorithm is presented below:

| **Moore contour tracing algorithm:**
| *Input:* An image :math:`T` containing a connected component :math:`C` of "black" cells.
| *Output:* A sequence :math:`B(b1, b2,..., bk)` of boundary pixels.
| **begin**
|  *Step 1.* Initialization: find a pixel in :math:`C`, initialize :math:`B`, define :math:`M(p)` to be the Moore neighborhood of the current pixel :math:`p`.
|  *Step 2.* Set :math:`B` to be empty.
|  *Step 3.* From bottom to top and left to right scan the cells of :math:`T` until a pixel :math:`s` of :math:`C` is found
      (until the current pixel :math:`p=s` is a "black" pixel of :math:`C`), insert :math:`s` in :math:`B`.
      Let :math:`b` denote the current boundary point, i.e., :math:`b=s`.
|  *Step 4.* Backtrack (move the current pixel to the pixel from which :math:`s` was entered) and advance the current pixel :math:`p` being examined to
      the next clockwise pixel in :math:`M(b)`.
|    **while** (:math:`p \neq s`)
|      **if** (:math:`p` is "black")
|         insert :math:`p` in :math:`B`;
|         set :math:`b=p`;
|         backtrack (move the current pixel to the pixel from which :math:`p=b` was entered);
|      **else**
|         advance the current pixel :math:`p` to the next clockwise pixel in :math:`M(b)`;
|    **end-while**
| **end**
